Basics of kubernetes
YAML Basics

Core concepts:
 1. cluster architecture
 2. API Primitives
 3. Services and other network primitives

Sccheduling:
 1. Labels and Selectors
 2. Resource Limits
 3. Manual Scheduling
 4. Daemon Sets
 5. Multiple Schedulers
 6. Scheduler Events
 7. Configure kubernetes scheduler

Logging and Monitoring:
 1. Monitor CLuster components
 2. Monitor Cluster component logs
 3. Monitor Applications
 4. Application Logs

Application Lifecycle Management
 1. Rolling Updates and Rollbacks in Deploy
 2. Configure Applications
 3. Scale Applications
 4. self-Healing Application

Cluster Maintenance
 1. Cluster Upgrade Process
 2. Operating system upgrades
 3. backup and restore methodologies

Security
 1. Authentication & Authorization(RBAC)
 2. Kubernetes Security
 3. Network Policies
 4. TLS certificates for cluster components
 5. Image security
 6. security contexts
 7. secure persistent key value store

Storage
 1. Persistent Volumes
 2. Access Modes for Volumes
 3. Persistent Volume Claims
 4. Kubernetes Storage Object
 5. Configure applications with persistent storage

Networking:
 1. IPAM(CNI)
 2. Pre-Requisites - Network,Switching, Routing, Tools
 3. pre-Requisites - DNS and CoreDNS
 4. Pre-Requisites - Network namespaces, Networking in docker
 5. Network configuration on cluster nodes
 6. Pod networking concepts
 7. Network Loadbalancer
 8. Ingress

 10. clusterDNS
 11. CNI(IPAM)

Installation,Configuration and validation
 1. Design kubernetes cluster
 2. Secure cluster communication
 3. HA kubernetes cluster
 4. Choose a network solution
 5. Run and analyze end-to-end tests
 6. TLS bootstapping

Troubleshooting
 1. Application Failure
 2. Control Plane failure
 3. Worker Node failure
 4. Networking
